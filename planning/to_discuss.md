#### things we need to discuss
- [ ] Are we using set points to allow connection between real-world and online visitors of the conference?
- [ ] Extra room view option? For example when you're in a call you get placed into an actual room around a table instead of a standard jitsi window. (we'd have to see if this is possible)
- [ ] Is it fine to use a log in with google/linked in button?
